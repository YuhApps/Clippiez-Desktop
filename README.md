# CLIPPIE DESKTOP

**Clippie** is designed for users who have to copy and paste from templates everyday. Define some clips in the app, and they'll always be there to be copied later.

You can download **Clippie** binaries for **Mac** (Intel and Apple Silicon), **64-bit Windows** and **64-bit Linux** from the [Releases](https://github.com/YuhApps/Clippiez-Desktop/releases/tag/v1.0.0) page. 32-bit Windows and Linux are not built due to low usage. However, because Clippie is an Electron-based app, feel free to clone the source code and run it on your computer in case you are a 32-bit Windows or Linux user. Just open Terminal and enter these very familiar commands, assuming you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed:

```
npm install
npm start
```

There's also a Chrome extension from [GitHub](https://github.com/YuhApps/Clippiez-Chrome) and [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clippiez/ialmfmcldokjkefelioamloepafmelon). Note that the desktop app and crx don't share data. You'll need to export and import JSON clips on your own to share the data between the two.
